# Marketing-Analytics-Insurance-Company-in-Python
This project was part of an Individual Assingment for the Big Data & Artificial Intelligence in Marketing class, and it aimmed to offer digital marketing strategies for an Insurance Company.

The main goal of the project is:

"[..] identify what information would be valuable for the company: what are the most effective channels, devices, age buckets or other available dimensions in terms of the metrics you will find and also conversion rate for leads (leads/sessions), bounce rate (bounces/sessions) and pageviews per session (pageviews/sessions). Also, if there is any hidden relationship that could be insightful for us. Our goal is to use artificial intelligence and big data so we can use this information to improve    how we are managing our digital marketing channels. How could we do it?"

In this repository, I recommend that you take a look at the PDF, which is the project report, and if you want to go deeper into the code, take a look at it later.

## Summary

Mapfre leads have not been increasing over time. The most important variables that influence the leads were analyzed and a Linear Regression model was applied to explain the relationship between them and offer clear guidelines to improve the results. It is expected that Mapfre can improve the leads focusing resources on paid advertising, users of 35-44 years old, female users and desktop connections. It is also recommended investigating the other non-conventional channels and evaluating the SEO strategy, especially regarding keyword performance.

## Introduction

The total number of daily leads have not been increasing since 2017. It is noticeable that there is a spike at the beginning of 2018, but it only seems to be a seasonal behavior that has occurred in the past. 

In the present document it is going to be presented an analysis of the most important marketing metrics to see where Mapfre can focus its attention to generate more leads in the future.

## Context

The channels that generate the greatest number of leads are Organic Search (36%), Paid Search (27%) and Other channels (22%), followed by Direct (7%) and Display (3%). By the other hand, Email, Social and Referral (<5% together) do not generate many leads compared to the other mentioned.

Organic Search seems to be the best channel to generate leads. Nonetheless, when comparing the leads per every 1000 sessions, we can see Organic Search has one of the worst ratios (<20 leads per 1000 sessions). This channel generates a larger number of sessions, but not many of the users are transformed into a lead. One of the possible explanations is that the SEO strategy is not focusing on the correct keywords. Email, for other side, has a better ratio, but fails to generate many leads.

The device category that generates more leads is Desktop (59%), followed by Mobile (38%). In comparison, Tablet (3%) generates a small number.

The age groups that generate more leads are 25-34 (43%) and 35-44 (28%), followed by 18-24 (12%) and 45-54 (11%). In comparison, 55-64 and +65 (6% together) generates a small number.

More than 60% of the leads are generated by female users.

There has been an important increase in the proportion of monthly mobile connections since 2017, reaching a peak (close to 38%) in January of 2018.

There has been an important decrease in the proportion of tablet connections since 2017, reaching its lowest point (12%) in January of 2018.

It is clear there is a negative relationship between the proportion of tablets connections and mobile connections.

There has been an increase in the proportion of connections through the non-conventional channels since 2017, but there is a visible decrease in 2018.

There has been an increase in the proportion of connections through the non-conventional channels since 2017, but there is a visible decrease in 2018.
The other features do not show a clear trend in the last years.

Finally, it seems that Mapfre has had five paid campaigns since 2017. They seem to have had a very good result, because they generated more than 27% of the total number of leads since 2017, as it was shown previously. An astonishing performance.

## Linear Regression model

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103886856/168421715-c17ad50c-4389-4ee6-8f4f-cee6077a99e1.png)

A Linear Regression was applied to have a better understanding of the relationship between the features and the leads. Only the most relevant variables were selected, with special care of removing as many collinearities as possible and having only those really significant for predicting the leads.
 
The model explains more than 67% of the behavior of the leads. And it was found that:
-	When the channel is Paid Search, the leads increase in 52% on average.
-	For every 1% increase in the users, the leads increased in 48% on average.
-	When the users are in the range of 35-44 years, the leads increase in 48% on average.
-	When the users are in the range of 18-24 years, the leads increase in 35% on average.
-	When the channel is one of the non-conventional, the leads increase in 20% on average.
-	When the users are in the range of 25-34 years, the leads increase in 15% on average.
-	When the users are in the range of 55-64 years, the leads increase in 14% on average.
-	For every 1% increase in the average time spend on page per session, the leads increased in 11% on average.
-	When there are female users, the leads increase 11% on average.
-	When the device is desktop, the leads increase 6% on average.
-	When the device is tablet, the leads decreased 19% on average.
-	When the channel is display, the leads decrease 20% on average.
-	When the channel is referral, the leads decrease 29% on average.
-	When the channel is email, the leads decrease 34% on average.
-	For every 1% increase in the average sessions per user, the leads decrease 47% on average.
-	When the channel is organic search, the leads decrease 59% on average.

## Recommendations 

Given the information shown in the document, Mapfre could increase its leads following the next recommendations:
-	Focus more resources on paid campaigns.
-	Focus its resources especially on users between 35-44 years old.
-	Investigate which are the other non-conventional channels that are generating leads.
-	Focus more resources on female users.
-	Focus more attention on users that navigates through desktop devices.
-	Do not focus many resources on email campaigns if the ultimate goal of it is generating leads.
-	Evaluate and improve the SEO strategy, especially regarding keyword performance.
