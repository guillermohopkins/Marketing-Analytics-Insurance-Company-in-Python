# Marketing-Analytics-Insurance-Company-in-Python
This project was part of an Individual Assingment for the Big Data & Artificial Intelligence in Marketing class, and it aimmed to offer digital marketing strategies for an Insurance Company.

The main goal of the project is:

"[..] identify what information would be valuable for the company: what are the most effective channels, devices, age buckets or other available dimensions in terms of the metrics you will find and also conversion rate for leads (leads/sessions), bounce rate (bounces/sessions) and pageviews per session (pageviews/sessions). Also, if there is any hidden relationship that could be insightful for us. Our goal is to use artificial intelligence and big data so we can use this information to improve    how we are managing our digital marketing channels. How could we do it?"

In this repository, I recommend that you take a look at the PDF, which is the project report, and if you want to go deeper into the code, take a look at it later.
